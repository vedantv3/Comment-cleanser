#  Comment Cleanser – Hate & Offensive Comment Detector

This is a Streamlit-based machine learning web app that detects whether a user-provided comment or tweet is categorized as **Hate Speech**, **Offensive**, or **Clean**. The model is trained using logistic regression and can **improve over time** by learning from newly encountered comments.

---

## 📌 Features

- 🔍 Classifies input into:
  - Hate Speech 😠
  - Offensive 😡
  - Clean 😊
- 📥 Learns from unknown/uncertain inputs (low confidence)
- 💡 Suggests clean alternative comments when toxic input is detected
- 🧠 Re-trains model using both original and feedback data
- 💬 Built with Streamlit for quick deployment and interaction

## 💾 Dataset

We use the [Hate Speech and Offensive Language Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lisaleesmith/hate-speech-and-offensive-language-dataset).

- `tweet` — Comment or tweet text
- `class` — Label:
  - 0 = Hate Speech
  - 1 = Offensive
  - 2 = Clean

env\Scripts\activate  # Windows
# OR
source env/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux

```

---
## ▶️ Run the App

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
---

--- 
## 📊 How It Works

- User submits a comment.

- The model classifies the comment into one of three categories.

- If prediction confidence is low (<65%), it stores the comment for learning.

- Suggestions are shown if the comment is toxic.

- App automatically re-trains using new data on-the-fly.

---
## 📸 Example Output
```bash
- Input: You're a dumb person
- Prediction: Offensive 😡
- Confidence: 91%

- Suggested Clean Comments:
  
    You're really smart!
    That was a great point.
```
